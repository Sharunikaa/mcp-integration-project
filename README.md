# MCP Notes Management System

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework that enables AI assistants to interact with external tools, services, and data sources through standardized interfaces. By using MCP, AI models can perform real-world actions and access up-to-date information beyond their training data, expanding their capabilities significantly.

This project demonstrates a practical implementation of MCP, focusing on notes management, while also showing how to integrate with GitHub, Slack, file system operations, Google Maps, and browser automation.

## üìä Project Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                # MCP server implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.txt              # Sample notes file containing information about GenAI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml         # Python project configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                   # Environment variables (create this file)
```

Create or update your `claude_desktop_config.json` file with the following MCP server definitions:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_github_token"
      }
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "C:\\Users\\your_username",
        "D:\\news_custom"
      ]
    },
    "slack": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "your_slack_token",
        "SLACK_TEAM_ID": "your_team_id",
        "SLACK_CHANNEL_IDS": "channel1,channel2"
      }
    },
    "google-maps": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": "your_google_maps_key"
      }
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    },
    "notes-assistant": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "main.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## üìù Implementation Details

### Notes Management

The project includes tools for managing notes:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def add_note(message: str) -> str:
    """
    Append a new note to the sticky note file.
    """
    # Adds a note to notes.txt
    
@mcp.tool()
def read_notes() -> str:
    """
    Read and return all notes from the sticky note file.
    """
    # Returns all stored notes
    
@mcp.resource("notes://latest")
def get_latest_note() -> str:
    """
    Get the most recently added note.
    """
    # Returns the last note
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Starting Your MCP Server

```bash
python main.py
```

### Notes Operations

```python
# Add a note
add_note(message="Important meeting tomorrow")

# Read all notes
read_notes()

# Get the latest note
get_latest_note()
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **MCP Server Not Starting**: Check if the correct version of Python is installed (3.13+)
2. **Tool Not Found Errors**: Ensure your Claude configuration points to the correct file paths
3. **Empty Results**: Make sure your notes.txt file exists and is writable
